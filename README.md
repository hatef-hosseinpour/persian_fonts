**Address table of Persian letters**
Python language does not have a function for Persian letters that shows the hex code for each letter. On the other hand, in Farsi, a word can be the beginning, middle, end, or independently, for which a separate hex code must be displayed.
Therefore, we wrote a Python script that displays the hex code of each letter in a word according to its position in the word according to this [file](https://github.com/hatef-hosseinpour/persian_fonts/blob/main/Persian%20Font%20Code.pdf) in the output.
